        <p>
            Welcome and thank you for stopping and taking a look at my portoflio. Currently I have experience with HTML and styling with CSS.
            Along with that with my project Run Buddy I refracted the code to better meet standards for accesability. Sharring work on Github in order to back up my work and also work with others. 
            In the near future I will be working with Javascript to continue building on the fundamentals of full stack development. 
        </p>
